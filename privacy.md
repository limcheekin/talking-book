**Privacy Policy for Talking Book Telegram Bot**

**Last Updated:** 15 May 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Lim Chee Kin ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and discloses information through the Talking Book Telegram Bot (the "Bot").

**By interacting with or using the Bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Bot.**

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect information that you provide directly to us when you interact with the Bot, as well as certain information automatically collected by the Telegram platform and processed by our Bot.

*   **Information You Provide Directly:**
    *   **Chat Data:** This includes the content of messages, commands, inputs, and any other information you send directly to the Bot in your chats. This is the primary data the Bot processes to function.
    *   **User Information:** When you interact with the Bot, Telegram provides us with basic information about your user account, such as your Telegram User ID, and potentially your username (if you have set one publicly) and profile language settings. We do not collect your real name, phone number, or other private Telegram account details unless you explicitly choose to share them *in a message to the bot* (which we advise against for sensitive information).
    *   **Group/Channel Information:** If you add the Bot to a group or channel, we may receive the group/channel ID and potentially the group/channel name, but generally, we only process messages *directed at the bot* (e.g., containing the bot's username or replies to the bot).

*   **Information Collected Automatically:**
    *   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you interact with the Bot, such as the specific commands you use, the frequency of your interactions, timestamps of messages, and technical information like error reports.
    *   **Technical Data:** Information about the interaction itself, such as the message ID and the type of chat (private, group, channel).

**We do not collect any sensitive personal information (such as race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health information, etc.) unless you voluntarily provide it within your chat data, which we do not encourage.**

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **Providing the Bot's Service:** To operate and provide the functionality of the Bot, process your commands, respond to your messages, and deliver the services you request.
*   **Improving the AI and Bot Performance:** **This is a key use of your Chat Data.** We use the content of your messages, commands, and interactions with the Bot to analyze patterns, understand user queries, identify areas for improvement, and **train and refine the underlying AI models** that power the Bot's responses and features. This helps the AI become more accurate, relevant, and helpful over time.
*   **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** To diagnose and fix technical issues, maintain the Bot's infrastructure, and ensure its stable operation.
*   **Analytics:** To understand usage patterns, track the popularity of features, and gather general statistics about Bot usage. This data is often anonymized or aggregated where possible.
*   **Developing New Features:** To research and develop new functionalities, services, and improvements based on user needs and usage patterns identified from the data.
*   **Communication:** To send you non-marketing messages related to the Bot's operation (e.g., service announcements, updates if applicable).
*   **Legal Compliance:** To comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**When using Chat Data for AI improvement, we prioritize privacy by:**

*   Using data in an aggregated or de-identified form where feasible for certain types of analysis.
*   Implementing access controls to limit who can access raw chat data used for training.
*   Focusing on the content and patterns rather than the identity of the specific user where possible during model training.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting providers, database management, or potentially third-party AI model providers (if we utilize external APIs for certain AI functions - e.g., sending prompts to a large language model API. In such cases, the data shared is limited to what is necessary for that service). These providers are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process.
*   **To Protect Rights and Safety:** We may disclose information when we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

**4. Data Storage and Security**

Your information is stored on secure servers managed by us or our service providers. We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**5. Data Retention**

We retain your information, including Chat Data, for as long as necessary to provide the Bot service, fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (including AI improvement), and comply with our legal obligations.

*   Chat Data used for AI training may be retained for a longer period to contribute to the ongoing improvement of the models. However, we will take steps to minimize the retention of identifiable Chat Data once it has served its primary purpose or has been incorporated into aggregated/anonymized training datasets.
*   You can request the deletion of your data as described in the "Your Rights" section below.

**6. Your Rights**

Depending on your location and applicable privacy laws, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:

*   **Right to Access:** You may have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you.
*   **Right to Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, including your Chat Data. To request deletion, please contact us using the contact details below or use any specific deletion command the Bot might offer (e.g., `/delete_my_data`). Please note that requesting deletion may impact your ability to use the Bot, and some data (especially data already incorporated into AI models in an unidentifiable way) may not be completely removed from historical training data sets, though it will be removed from active storage and future training uses where feasible.
*   **Right to Object or Restrict Processing:** You may have the right to object to or request the restriction of certain processing activities, particularly those related to using data for AI improvement. Please contact us to inquire about this.
*   **Right to Data Portability:** (Less applicable for a Bot, but mention as a potential right).
*   **Right to Lodge a Complaint:** You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your personal information violates applicable law.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

**7. Third-Party Services (Telegram)**

The Bot operates on the Telegram messaging platform, which is a third-party service. Your use of Telegram is governed by Telegram's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for Telegram's practices or policies regarding your data.

**8. Children's Privacy**

The Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by your country's laws to use online services without parental consent). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under the applicable age, we will take steps to delete it.

**9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by the bot's welcome message before the changes become effective. Your continued use of the Bot after the effective date of the revised policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
